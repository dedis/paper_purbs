# Padding experiments

You need matplotlib/numpy and go to run the experiments (do `make install` and `make install-experiments` on the main repo)

This folder contains:

- `Makefile` which wires everything
- `*.sizes` which are the datasets used
- `padme.py` which is the Padm√© padding
- `*.py` which produces the plots/tables shown in the paper

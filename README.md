# Padded Uniform Random Blobs

A library for a novel encoding approach preventing metadata leakage for encrypted communication and data at rest.

```
make example
```

The folder `experiments-encoding` contains simulation about PURBs encoding and decoding, and the duration of those operations.

The folder `experiments-padding` contains an evaluation of Padm√©, the padding algorithm for PURBs.
